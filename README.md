# Python, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python-based projects focused on
machine learning, data analysis and reproducible ML workflows.

The goal of this repository is to showcase practical skills in:
- data exploration and preprocessing,
- classical machine learning,
- model evaluation and comparison,
- clean project structure and reproducibility.

In the future, the repository will be extended with **deep learning projects**
covering areas such as **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

## Projects

### 🔹 Machine Learning

- [Titanic Survival Prediction](./titanic_ml)
  - Binary classification problem
  - End-to-end ML pipeline (EDA → preprocessing → training → evaluation)
  - Multiple models compared using common metrics

---

## Planned extensions

- Deep Learning projects using frameworks such as PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Computer Vision (image classification, CNNs)
- Natural Language Processing (text classification, embeddings, transformers)
- More advanced model tuning and interpretation techniques
