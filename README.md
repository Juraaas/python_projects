# Python, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python-based projects focused on
machine learning, data analysis and reproducible ML workflows.

The goal of this repository is to showcase practical skills in:
- data exploration and preprocessing,
- classical machine learning,
- model evaluation and comparison,
- clean project structure and reproducibility.

In the future, the repository will be extended with **deep learning projects**
covering areas such as **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.
