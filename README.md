# Python, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python-based projects focused on
machine learning, deep learning, data analysis and reproducible ML workflows.

The goal of this repository is to showcase practical skills in:
- data exploration and preprocessing,
- classical machine learning and unsupervised learning,
- deep learning applications using modern architectures,
- model evaluation and comparison,
- system-oriented thinking and clean project structure.

The projects emphasize not only model performance, but also **end-to-end
pipelines**, **business-oriented problem framing**, and **reproducibility**.
