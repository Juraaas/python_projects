# Smart Retail Shelf Analytics

This project demonstrates a real-time computer vision system for monitoring
product availability on retail shelves using YOLO-based object detection combined with temporal analytics and decision logic.

The goal of the system is to support automated shelf monitoring by detecting
products, estimating stock levels and enabling data-driven restocking decisions in retail environments.

---

## Project motivation

Manual shelf monitoring in retail environments is time-consuming, error-prone and difficult to scale. An automated vision-based system can detect out-of-stock situations early and provide actionable insights for store operations.

Rather than focusing purely on object detection accuracy, this project explores how modern computer vision models can be integrated into a robust temporal decision-making system, where stability, observability and system behavior are treated as first-class design goals.

## System overview

The system processes video input from a webcam or video file and performs
real-time object detection using a pretrained YOLOv8 model.

High-level pipeline:

Video stream → Frame capture → YOLO detection → Object tracking → Shelf analytics → Decision logic → Visualization & Logging → Offline evaluation

The project is designed as a modular system, where detection, business logic, logging
and visualization are clearly separated to allow further extensions and experiments.

## Implemented features

### Phase 1 – Detection MVP
- real-time video capture from webcam or video file,
- object detection using a pretrained YOLOv8 model,
- visualization of detected objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores,
- FPS measurement to evaluate real-time performance.

### Phase 2 – Shelf Analytics & Decision Logic
- product counting based on filtered detections,
- rolling window averaging to stabilize counts across frames,
- configurable minimum stock threshold,
- delayed alert triggering to reduce false positives caused by transient occlusions,
- real-time visualization of current count, average count and alert status.

The alert logic ensures that low-stock notifications are triggered only when
the condition persists over multiple consecutive frames, making the system
robust to short-term disturbances such as hand occlusions or camera noise.

### Phase 2.5 – Event Logging & Observability
- structured logging of shelf state and system performance to CSV files,
- hybrid logging strategy combining:
  - periodic logging (time-based snapshots),
  - event-based logging (alert state changes),
- recorded fields include timestamps, product counts, alert states and FPS.

This logging approach significantly reduces data volume while preserving
all critical information required for offline evaluation, debugging and
performance analysis.

### Phase 2.5.1 – Object Tracking (Initial Integration)
- integration of a multi-object tracker to assign persistent IDs to detected products,
- improved temporal consistency of product counts across frames,
- reduced counting instability caused by frame-to-frame detection vatiance.

The tracker introduces identity persistence across frames, forming the foundation for higher-level analytics such as zone-based counting and long-term shelf state estimation.

Tracker parameters are currently being tuned to further improve ID stability
under occlusions and rapid motion.

### Phase 3 – Offline Evaluation & System Analysis

- offline evaluation pipeline operating on logged system events,
- statistical analysis of shelf behavior and system stability,
- performance diagnostics including: count distribution statistics, FPS performance analysis, alert activation and duration metrics, temporal stability indicators (count changes and jumps).

## Performance

The detection pipeline runs in real time on a laptop webcam with stable
performance (approximately 10–15 FPS), demonstrating feasibility under
limited hardware constraints without GPU acceleration.

## Design considerations 

- The system prioritizes decision stability and temporal consistency over perfect frame-level detection accuracy.
- Detection, tracking and business logic are intentionally decoupled to allow independent experimentation.
- Temporal smoothing and delayed decisions reflect real-world retail conditions where short visual disturbances are common.
- Logging and evaluation are treated as core system components enabling reproducibility and iterative improvement.
- The architecture follows a production-oriented vision pipeline rather than a single-model approach.

---

## Next Steps

Planned extensions of the project include:
- further tuning of tracker parameters to improve ID persistence,
- hysteresis-based alert logic for improved decision stability,
- shelf memory mechanisms to handle temporary occlusions,
- quantitative metrics for counting accuracy and alert precision,
- zone-based shelf analysis (front vs back of shelf),
- advanced visualization and reporting.
